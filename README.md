Tornado Sign Maker is a JavaScript-based app for creating highway guide signs. Based off of[JKPotato-Computer's SignMaker ](https://github.com/JKPotato-Computer/SignMaker), as well as [Kurumi's Sign Maker](http://www.kurumi.com/roads/signmaker) Allows for the creation of highway guide signs in the style defined by the United States FHWA in their [MUTCD](https://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov/kno_2009r1r2.htm).

This version of SignMaker is an attempt to "Make Sign Maker Great Again" baised off of JKPotato Sign Maker, this fork uses most of the sign mechanics used in the real world, we plan on adding several things in the future, including:
- More Toll and Hwy Shields
- Shields from Other countries
- More Gantry Types
And Much more.
